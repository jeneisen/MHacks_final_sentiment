Polimetrics.tk is a web app we built during MHACKS 2013 at the Big House. We primarily used Go and Ruby on Rails on the backend and Javascript and Nodejs on the front end. Polimetrics uses the AlchemyAPI to complete sentiment keyword analysis on Tweets by Americans. The API analyzes American's ever fluctuating spirits towards other countries around the world and we chose to visualize that grand data based on a scale of positive, negative, or neutral emotions using a color-emotive map.
